# seo-registrations-forecast
This project is a Streamlit app for visualizing and forecasting user registrations from SEO (non-branded traffic) on a platform using the Shamsi (Solar Hijri) calendar.

It compares:

Year 1403 registrations (full year)

Year 1404 registrations (first 6 months of actual data)

Forecasted registrations for months 7â€“12 of 1404

The app allows you to upload a CSV file with registration data, view year-over-year comparisons, and forecast the next 6 months using different forecasting methods (linear regression, polynomial regression, exponential regression).
